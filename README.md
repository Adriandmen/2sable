# 2sable
A new (experimental) golfing language, derivated from 05AB1E. The name **2sable** comes from the words two and usable, which results into twosable. Although it's very similar to 05AB1E, 2sable uses only **1 input**. This means that for example the program `*` doesn't request input twice, but only _once_.  

For information about all the commands, go to _Info.txt_


###Sample programs (which are different from 05AB1E):


Prints the input squared:

    *

Of course, `n` would also do the job. However, `*` multiplies the input by itself rather than requesting for another input.

Prints n<sup>2</sup> + n:
    
    n+


###Note:

Note that this is an unstable language, with a lot of bugs. If you find any, or have any suggestions, feel free to contact me :)
